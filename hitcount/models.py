        How you count a hit/view will depend on personal choice: Should the
        same user/visitor *ever* be counted twice?  After a week, or a month,
        or a year, should their view be counted again?

        The defaulf is to consider a visitor's hit still 'active' if they 
        return within a the last seven days..  After that the hit
        will be counted again.  So if one person visits once a week for a year,
        they will add 52 hits to a given object.

        Change how long the expiration is by adding to settings.py:
