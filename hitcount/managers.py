        Return only the 'active' hits.

        How you count a hit/view will depend on personal choice: Should the
        same user/visitor *ever* be counted twice?  After a week, or a month,
        or a year, should their view be counted again?

        The default is to consider a visitor's hit still 'active' if they
        return within a the last seven days..  After that the hit
        will be counted again.  So if one person visits once a week for a year,
        they will add 52 hits to a given object.

        Change how long the expiration is by adding to settings.py:

        HITCOUNT_KEEP_HIT_ACTIVE  = {'days' : 30, 'minutes' : 30}

        Accepts days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes,
        hours, and weeks.  It's creating a datetime.timedelta object.
